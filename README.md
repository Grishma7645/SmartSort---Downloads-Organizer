# SmartSort-Downloads Organizer
Python-based automation tool that monitors your Downloads folder and automatically organizes files into designated directories based on their type.

It uses the Watchdog library to detect file modifications in real-time and moves them into categorized folders (e.g., images, videos, documents, music). The program ensures that duplicate file names are handled gracefully by renaming them uniquely.
